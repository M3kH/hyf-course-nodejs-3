Great that you make it to enable Travis CI here! ðŸŽ‰

But you could later see that our test would be failing?
Don't worry this is by purpose! 

Check the current branch locally and start to Apply the changes needed to make the test pass.

You first need to create a file under `src/index.js`, this file should start an express server and that responds to the root url `/` with the body `Hello World!`. Ah and would be listen to the port `3000`.

I know that is very little hint, but I'm confident that you can find the informations that you need.
Show me what can you do!
