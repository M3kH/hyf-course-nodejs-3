Great! I'm impress from your progess! ðŸ’ª

Now that we manage to `get` and `create` a user another important functionality
is to `delete` a user.

Try to implement an `delete` method, the User Story would look like:

**Delete user:**
<pre>
  <b>As</b> Developer<br/>
  <b>when</b> create a <b>DELETE</b> request at <b>/user/:id</b><br/> 
  <b>then</b> I will recieve a the user and a status code of <b>200</b>.<br/>
  <b>if</b> the user doesn't exists:<br/>
  <b>then</b> the status code returned would be <b>204</b>.<br/>
</pre>

You can continue from this [PR]({{ prUrl }})
