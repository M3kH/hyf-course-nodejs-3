# Welcome

In this repository, we'll exercise with NodeJS.

We would build a *RESTful* **Server**.

You may be thinking, "What exactly is it, and do I need it in my project?"

## What do we need a Server? Why should be RESTful?

When building a Web Applications, we need to make sure to split the responsability between Server and Client.
Server is where usally you centralise and store the information.
Client is where you interact with that data.

Among different way to make Client and Server communicate, a pattern that has show his advantage is REST.
REST serves a set of rules that apply to Paths and HTTP Methods, to avoid reinventing a style of communication between those Components. 

So, are you exited to start?

Before, we cam continue, we need to Setup a Continuous Integration tool, to run our tests.
